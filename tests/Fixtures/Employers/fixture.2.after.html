We also provide a comprehensive induction process and an informal buddy system for new team members. Although our psychologists work independently from a clinical perspective, we are fortunate to have a lovely sense of community and collaboration within our team.</p> <h3><em>Attractive Terms</em></h3> <p>We offer competitive remuneration, genuinely flexible working conditions and a transparent, non-restrictive Independent Contractor arrangement.
