<p>We&rsquo;re on the lookout for experienced and friendly psychologists to join our wonderful team.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re seeking an exceptional working environment, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a little bit about us:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our Practice Director</em></strong></p>
<p>Our practice director, Dr Jacqueline Baulch, is a Clinical Psychologist. Jacqueline is hands-on, responsive and dedicated to creating an ethical, client-centred practice where psychologists feel supported and valued.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Support Team</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a wonderful Support Team and Support Team Managers who look after both our clients and psychologists. They take care of most reception and administration duties, leaving our psychologists to focus their time and energy on clients.</p>
<p><strong><em>Referrals</em></strong></p>
<p>We have a constant stream of referrals so our psychologists are never concerned about having a quiet calendar. At the same time though, we believe in balance and self-care, so we encourage our psychologists to take breaks from new referrals when they want or need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Clients</em></strong></p>
<p>Our clients come with a range of presenting issues and from a variety of backgrounds, so we are lucky to be able to offer a varied and rewarding clinical caseloads.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beautiful Spaces</em></strong></p>
<p>We provide beautifully appointed, professional consulting rooms. To see pictures of our spaces visit the &ldquo;locations&rdquo; tab on our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Network</em></strong></p>
<p>We have strong links with GPs, psychiatrists, allied health practitioners and other psychologists. A significant number of clients find us through word of mouth from current clients and through our website and social media.</p>
<p><strong><em>Three Central Locations</em></strong></p>
<p>We have three locations, in Kensington, Fitzroy North and Melbourne CBD. Our Kensington clinic is a stand-alone converted warehouse that was renovated at the beginning of 2017. Our CBD and Fitzroy North rooms are located in in the same building as a holistic health centre.</p>
<p><strong><em>Community</em></strong></p>
<p>We understand that private practice can be isolating, so in addition to support from our Director and Support Team, we facilitate peer supervision, team meetings, complimentary professional development evenings and have a monthly team newsletter.&nbsp;We also provide a comprehensive induction process and an informal buddy system for new team members.&nbsp;Although our psychologists work independently from a clinical perspective, we are fortunate to have a lovely sense of community and collaboration within our team.</p>
<p><strong><em>Attractive Terms</em></strong></p>
<p>We offer competitive remuneration, genuinely flexible working conditions and a transparent, non-restrictive Independent Contractor arrangement. We encourage and value our psychologists working in other settings because we believe this fosters a fresh, innovative and dynamic team.</p>
