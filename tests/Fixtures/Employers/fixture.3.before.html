        <p><strong>What does Red Earth do? </strong></p>
        <p><span>Red Earth partners with Traditional Owners in Cape York, Central Australia and Arnhem Land, and assists them in hosting groups on their land. Groups spend 10 days doing cultural activities, completing a project on a homeland, visiting sacred sites &amp; spend time having a yarn with the Traditional Owners of the land. In doing so, they develop a genuine connection with the Traditional people and the country they live on. </span></p>
        <p><span>Red Earth specialises in unique experiences that are not available outside of this setting. We foster one-on-one relationships with the Traditional Owners we work with and are the only external group to have access to the homelands we visit. </span></p>
        <p><span>Red Earth also spends time preparing the groups for their travel to remote Indigenous Australia, and sends leaders and volunteers with the groups to help facilitate the experience. </span></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>What will you do as a volunteer? </strong></p>
        <p><span>As a Red Earth volunteer, you will be working alongside a Red Earth leader, in conjunction with Traditional Owners, to deliver a cultural immersion experience for a group of people from a major Australian city. </span></p>
        <p><span>Once in community, you will stay on homelands with Traditional Owners, and spend time undertaking cultural &amp; spiritual activities, swimming in waterfalls and getting to know the locals. Your role will be to support the leader and the Traditional Owners as needed, and to soak up the experience of living in remote Indigenous Australia! </span></p>

        <p><strong>What will you get out of the experience? </strong></p>
        <p><span>You will have the opportunity to get to know Traditional Owners in their own backyard, and hear from them first-hand about their culture, history, challenges and the importance of living on their country. </span></p>
        <p><span>You will get to visit some of Australia&rsquo;s most remote communities, with all expenses paid including flights. </span></p>
